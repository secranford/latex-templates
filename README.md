# LaTeX Templates Repo

- This is a Repo to store my different LaTeX files, examples, and templates for my own use or for sharing with others.
- `original-files` is a repo containing the LaTeX template files from [@SeniorMars' repository][senior-mars-repo]. 
- `notes-template` is a repo adapted from that template to suit my own needs and preferences for taking notes on different topics.
- `standalone` is a repo for using the standalone class to export equations or figures made in LaTeX, i.e. create a pdf of an equation or TikZ figure exactly so it can be inserted in a document or presentation. 

## Some good resources:

- [Video][SeniorMars-Notes] on some useful tips for taking notes/doing hw in LaTeX
- Blog posts [1][blog-one] and [2][blog-two] on note-taking and tips inspired the template I copied from.
- LaTeX workshop is the VS Code extension I use. It has many nice features and good [documentation][lt-work]. Use `latexmk` for building (this is how Overleaf and many compilers auto handle compiling).
