# This is a Repo to store my different LaTeX files, examples, and templates for my own use or for sharing with others.

- `original-files` is a repo containing the LaTeX template files from [@SeniorMars' repository][senior-mars-repo]. 
- `notes-template` is a repo adapted from that template to suit my own needs and preferences for taking notes on different topics.

## Some good resources:

- [Video][SeniorMars-Notes] on some useful tips for taking notes/doing hw in LaTeX
- Blog posts [1][blog-one] and [2][blog-two] on note-taking and tips inspired the template I copied from.
