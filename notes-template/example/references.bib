  abstract  = {"The book is divided into two parts based on the overall goals, with the first part focusing on fundamental considerations, and the second part dedicated to describing computer simulation methods. The first section covers three different areas: (1) kinetic theory, (2) quantum mechanics, and (3) statistical mechanics. Important results from these three areas are then brought together to allow analysis of nonequilibrium processes in a gas based on molecular level considerations. Chapter 1 covers kinetic theory, in which the basic idea is to develop techniques to relate the properties and behavior of particles, representing atoms and molecules, to the fluid mechanical aspects of a gas at the macroscopic level. This requires us to provide a basic definition by what is meant by a particle, and how these particles interact with one another through the mechanism of inter-molecular collisions. This leads us into a discussion of modeling of macroscopic molecular transport processes, such as viscosity and thermal conductivity, that represents one of the first key successes of kinetic theory. We will find that kinetic theory relies on the use of statistical analysis techniques, such as probability density functions, due to the very large volumes of information involved in tracking the behavior of every single particle in a real gas flow"--},

  abstract     = {Hypersonic flows are energetic and result in regions of high temperature, causing internal energy excitation, chemical reactions, ionization, and gas surface interactions. At typical flight conditions, the rates of these processes are often similar to the rate of fluid motion. Thus, the gas state is out of local thermodynamic equilibrium and must be described by conservation equations for the internal energy and chemical state. Examples illustrate how competition between rates in hypersonic flows can affect aerodynamic performance, convective heating, boundary layer transition, and ablation. The conservation equations are outlined, and the most widely used models for internal energy relaxation, reaction rates, and transport properties are reviewed. Gas-surface boundary conditions are described, including finite rate catalysis and slip effects. Recent progress in the use of first-principles calculations to understand and quantify critical gas-phase reactions is discussed. An advanced finite-rate carbon ablation model is introduced and is used to illustrate the role of rate processes at hypersonic conditions.},
